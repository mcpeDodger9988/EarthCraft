  I cant seem to make these 2 functions that I can use in EarthcraftLayers.cpp for each of the random values that are generated between 1-6(randa) and between 1-5(randb),these are seperate functions that I placed one inside another for simplicity, this might make the code simpler and faster in EarthcraftLayers.cpp
  If anyone can make this then please post a pulse with your suggestion and I will test your suggestion
  If your suggestion helps improve the code then I will give you credit for your contribution

/*void printSpace() {
  cout<<" "<<endl;
} //spacing function
declared in EarthcraftLayers.cpp because of problems declaring in this file*/
