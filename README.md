# EarthCraft
Im making a parody of Minecraft called EarthCraft and I am just starting with some simple code that generates a 32x32 world
For now the data for this is being made in 2D
If anyone can simplify this code without changing what the code does then please do so.
Any questions or concerns please email me at my school email: dodgealexander@Waynecsd.org
